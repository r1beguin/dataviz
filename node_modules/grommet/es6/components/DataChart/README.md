## DataChart
Takes a data set and visualizes it. While Chart renders a
    single value across a data set. DataChart allows multiple overlayed
    Charts and adds guides and axes for decoration.

## Usage

```javascript
import { DataChart } from 'grommet';
<DataChart data={data} property={} />
```

## Properties

**a11yTitle**

Custom label to be used by screen readers. When provided, an aria-label will
   be added to the element.

```
string
```

**alignSelf**

How to align along the cross axis when contained in
      a Box or along the column axis when contained in a Grid.

```
start
center
end
stretch
```

**gridArea**

The name of the area to place
    this inside a parent Grid.

```
string
```

**margin**

The amount of margin around the component. An object can
    be specified to distinguish horizontal margin, vertical margin, and
    margin on a particular side.

```

**axis**

Whether to show an axis and how it should look.
      If 'x' or 'y' is a string, it indicates the property to use
      to determine the values to show.
      If axis or 'x' is true, DataChart will look for a property called 'date'
      or 'time' and automatically use that for the x-axis. If DataChart
      can't find a property to use, it will use the data index for the x-axis.
      If axis or 'y' is true, DataChart will use the first property in 'series'.
      'granularity' indicates how many values to show.
      'coarse' granularity shows two values, one at each end.
      'fine' granularity shows all x-axis values and 5 y-axis values.
      'medium' granularity picks something in between. Defaults to `true`.

```
boolean
{
  x: 
    boolean
    string
    {
      property: string,
      granularity: 
        coarse
        medium
        fine
    },
  y: 
    boolean
    string
    {
      property: string,
      granularity: 
        coarse
        medium
        fine
    }
}
```

**bounds**

When set to 'align', indicates that the bounds of all series
      should be aligned. When not set, the bounds of each series
      property are based solely on the data found for that property. Defaults to `align`.

```
align
```

**chart**

How to visualize the data.
    'property' indicates which property of the data objects to use.
    When 'property' is an array, multiple properties are used for a
    stacked bar chart. If only a string is specified, that is the property
    to use and all other aspects are defaulted. If 'property' is an object,
    it specifies a map of properties to graphic aspects: x, y, color, thickness.
    If 'transform' is specified, it will be used to transform the data value
    before using it. For example, to convert a data value to a hex color
    string for the color.

```

  property:

      functions therein.

    data values shown in an axis, legend, or details. 'render' allows custom
    rendering of the data value. 'render' is called with:
    (value, datum, property) => { return < />; }
